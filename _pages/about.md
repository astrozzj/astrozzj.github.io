I'm Zijian Zhang (张子健). I'm an HKU Presidential PhD Scholars at The University of Hong Kong. My research is about simulating X-ray reflection signals from the black hole accretion systems and developing software packages for observers. I'm also analyzing the observation data. I obtained my B.S. in Astronomy from Nanjing University, where I worked on Fast Radio Bursts and their cosmological applications.

I was born in Jinzhou, a coastal city in northeastern China. Jinzhou is famous for its barbecue, you must try! I learnt calligraphy, go when I was a child and still practice occasionally. I have been playing football for more that 10 years, and served as an assistant coach of the female football team of Nanjing U. I started running since 2022, and finished my first 10km, half marathon and marathon.
